# RH_Role_Mortality
This is the code for the paper "Regional Variation in the Role of Humidity on City-level Heat-Related Mortality" published in PNAS Nexus.

This repository includes the Python and R scripts to plot the main figures in the manuscript (i.e., Figs 1-5 in the main text), the algorithms to calculate the heat stress indicators (HSI), the DLNM code, and the Random Forest code. 

All these scripts, except for the DLNM analysis, can be run with the necessary intermediary data. The data for Figs. 3, 4, 5, and Random Forest are uploaded to this repository, and the data for Figs 1 and 2 are not uploaded due to data size.   

This script was developed and tested in Python 3.7.12, R 4.0.3, and Linux platforms, and it can also be run on Windows with proper environment settings.

If there is any question about the code, please contact the following email:

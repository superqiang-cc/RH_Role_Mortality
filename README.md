# RH_Role_Mortality
This is the code for the paper "Regional Variation in the Role of Humidity on City-level Heat-Related Mortality".

This repository includes the Python and R scripts to plot the main figures in the manuscript (i.e., Figs 1-5 in the main text and Fig. S1), the algorithms to calculate the heat stress indicators (HSI), the DLNM code, and the Random Forest code. 

All these scripts except for the DLNM analysis can be run with the necessary intermediary data, which will be uploaded to this repository when the paper is published.  

This script is developed and tested in Python 3.7.12, R 4.0.3, and Linux platform, and can be run also in Windows with proper environment settings.

If there is any question about the code, please contact the following email:
